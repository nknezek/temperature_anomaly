# Global Temperature Anomaly 

This is a small project to visualize Earth's global temperature anomaly away from the recorded global average between 1961-90, inspired by the visualization [here](http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/spirals/) by [@ed_hawkins](http://twitter.com/ed_hawkins). This produces a video showing the evolution of the temperature anomaly each month through 2016 as well as the +2C target set by the Paris Climate Accords.
